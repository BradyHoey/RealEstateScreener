# RealEstateScreener
https://public.tableau.com/app/profile/brady.hoey/viz/RealEstateScreener/Dashboard1

The goal of this project is to use data analytics tools to make the process of finding real estate investments easier. 
Using Zillow data, I was able to create a report that provides real estate investors a way to find their next potential market without having to do all the research manually.

Potential Limitations: This dataset does not include zip codes with an average housing price of less than $180,000 or zip codes with an average rent above $4,500. 
Zip codes with less home sale postings on Zillow may contain inconsistent data due to outliers.
